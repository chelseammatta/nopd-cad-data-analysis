## FILTER OFFICER-INITIATED CALLS

This query filters out public-initiated calls (`SelfInitiated = FALSE`), keeping only those initiated by officers.

Similar query structure was applied to filter out self-initiated calls, which resulted in 2 distinct lists: calls that were served and initiated by police, and calls that were served and initiated by the public.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `melodic-crane-461722-j0.nola_crime.nopd_with_geo_corrected`
WHERE SelfInitiated = FALSE
ORDER BY CleanTimeCreate;
```
This table supports comparisons between officer-driven and public-driven call response patterns.
