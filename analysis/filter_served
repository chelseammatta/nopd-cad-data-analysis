## FILTER SERVED

This query filters out unserved calls, keeping only those with an officer response (i.e., `Served = TRUE`).

This allows focused analysis on incidents where police actually responded, supporting accurate metrics on response times and resource allocation.

```sql
SELECT *

FROM `melodic-crane-461722-j0.nola_crime.nopd_with_servedboolean` 

WHERE Served = TRUE
ORDER BY CleanTimeCreate;
