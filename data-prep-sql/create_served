## CREATE SERVED COLUMN

This query creates a new column named Served that flags whether a call received an officer response.

It evaluates the CleanTimeArrival timestamp -- if the field is not NULL, the call is marked as TRUE (served); otherwise, it is FALSE (unserved).

This distinction is critical for downstream analyses, including identifying service gaps, calculating average response times, and measuring overall resource allocation. Over 11,000 calls in the dataset were found to be unserved.

```sql
SELECT 
  *,
  CASE
    WHEN CleanTimeArrival IS NOT NULL THEN TRUE
    ELSE FALSE
  END AS Served

FROM `melodic-crane-461722-j0.nola_crime.nopd_cleaned_data_v2_with_geo` 

ORDER BY CleanTimeCreate;
```
