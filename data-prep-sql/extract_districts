## FILTER FOR ONLY DATA FROM 3RD AND 4TH DISTRICTS

This query filters from all CAD data from 2019-2022 from all districts and returns a table containing only calls from the 3rd and 4th districts.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `melodic-crane-461722-j0.nola_crime.nola_crime_all_2019_2022`
WHERE
  PoliceDistrict = 3
  OR
  PoliceDistrict = 4;
```
This reduced my dataset from over 1.7 million rows to approximately 480,000.
