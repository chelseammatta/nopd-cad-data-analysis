## JOIN SELFINITIATED COLUMN

This query joins the SelfInitiated boolean column back into my dataset by joining on the CleanTimeCreate timestamp. 

The SelfInitiated flag is an important indicator for distinguishing police calls initiated by officers themselves versus those initiated by the public.

The resulting table supports analysis by enabling creation of two master datasets: one for self-initiated calls with officer response and one for public-initiated calls with officer respoinse.
