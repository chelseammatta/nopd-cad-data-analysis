## TYPETEXT COUNT

This query counts how often each unique call type (`InitialTypeText_Cleaned`) appears in the dataset, sorted in ascending order. The structure of this 
query was reused multiple times throughout the project to inform cleanup, formatting, renaming, and category consolidation decisions.

Using this approach, I reduced the number of distinct call types from over **270** to just **73**, enabling more effective aggregation and analysis.

```sql
-- count the number of times each type of InitialTypeText_Cleaned appears in the table and order by ascending
SELECT
  InitialTypeText_Cleaned,
  COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM
  `melodic-crane-461722-j0`.`nola_crime`.`2019_2022_nola_crime_cleanedtypetext2`
GROUP BY
  InitialTypeText_Cleaned
ORDER BY
  Count ASC;
```
