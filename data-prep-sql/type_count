## TYPETEXT COUNT

This query counted the frequency of each call type and sorted in order from least to most. This query structure was used several times to populate this list.

This list was used to help inform decisions based on cleanup, formatting, and re-naming similar call types, as well as categorization.

I reduced the number of distinct call types from over 270 to just 73.

```sql
-- count the number of times each type of InitialTypeText_Cleaned appears in the table and order by ascending
SELECT
  InitialTypeText_Cleaned,
  COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM
  `melodic-crane-461722-j0`.`nola_crime`.`2019_2022_nola_crime_cleanedtypetext2`
GROUP BY
  InitialTypeText_Cleaned
ORDER BY
  Count;
```
