## REMOVE INCIDENT TYPE OUTLIERS

This query removes low-frequency incident types from the dataset to declutter analysis and reduce skew caused by extremely rare event labels.

Incident types that appeared fewer than 40 times were excluded **unless** they represented severe events (e.g., suicide, homicide), which were retained regardless of frequency.
