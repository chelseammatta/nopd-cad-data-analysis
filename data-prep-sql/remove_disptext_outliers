## REMOVE DISPOSITION TEXT OUTLIERS

This query removes the DispositionText irrelevant or test data rows, including Test Incident, VOID and DUPLICATE. These were removed because 
they were not applicable for my analysis purposes.

```sql
-- removes Test Incident (spelt two different ways in table), VOID, and DUPLICATE disposition calls
SELECT *
FROM `melodic-crane-461722-j0.nola_crime.2019_2022_nola_crime_cleantypetext3`
WHERE DispositionText NOT IN ('Test Incident', 'Test incident', 'VOID', 'DUPLICATE');
```
